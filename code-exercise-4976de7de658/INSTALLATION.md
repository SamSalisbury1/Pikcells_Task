#Installation / Running instructions

Some of the scripts in this project are modules and do not have access to run locally due to the fact they are blocked by Chromes CORS policy. In order to run the application it must be ran from a local server. I used the live server extension on vs code.

In order to sue live server download it from the extensions tab of vs code. Then Right click on Main.html and select the option "Open With Live Server".
